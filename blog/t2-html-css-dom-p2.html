  <li>What is "grid based design" (GBD)? </li>
  <p>It is a style of formating a page. Usually GBD involves a key feature on the left with a heading and text below following to the right of this feature. This feature could be something that catches the eye, such as an image. GBD is when the layout uses grids with the format mentioned above. It is used to make it easy for the user </p>

  <li>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</li>
  <p>It is all about having pages that are incredibly easy to use. Usually responsive webpages are made as basic as possible, which therefore makes less of a job for the user to get around and achieve what they went on the website for. Beyond this it is about making the website consistent across different platforms like tablet, cellphone and pc/lap tops.</p>

  <li>What is semantic structure?</li>
  <p>Structure of html coding that is directly rated to specific content, such as images, headings, footers etc. Semantic structure involved more visible elements compared to elements such as 'div' and span'. </p>

  <p>Put simply it is a standardised way of formatting HTML. </p>
