    <li>What did I learn from watching "Search Inside Yourself"?</li>
     <p>I learnt that emotional intelligence plays a huge part in feeling happy in life and in fact doing well in certain aspects of life such as your career and in social groups. There are actually ways of increasing your emotional intelligence. Focussing on taking a minute or two before you get into a task can make you think about why you are doing it, what you can achieve etc. This gives you a purpose when doing a task, rather than just having to do it. </p>

     <p>Thinking about things that we don't usually find time tothink about is key. For example instead of just meeting some co-workers, think about how you are going to approach them, what they want and how they may feel if you say certain things. This gives you an immediate advantage. Think postively. If you are potentially going to approach someone with conflict, think about 
     <i>trying to make that person happy.</i> this will mean that you are able to go in with a much better outlook. </p>

     <p>Another thing that I vaguely knew already is that EI is found to play a lot more importance in a workplace in terms of performance compared to IQ. Out of the top six attributes of a performer, only two were IQ specific and the other four were related to EI.</p>

     <p>Lastly, I learnt that happiness can come from your body. Your mind and body are incredibly sychronised and science has proved this. I have previously read that sportsmen and women when they raise their hands in the air in celebration feel more confident and overall more emotional than if their hands were by their sides.</p>


    <li>How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness?</li>
     <p>Incredibly relaxing. I felt relatively stressed today. (Not too bad). But when I focussed on my breathing for 2-3 minutes I noticed an immediate change and almost a clarity in my mind.</p>
