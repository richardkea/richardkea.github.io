    <li>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way I tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</li>
      <p>I looked at how other people had done theirs. It helped to see fully functional websites and their layout of CSS.</p>

    <li>What I thought about meditation before reading chapter 2?</li>

      <p>When I had previously attempted meditation, I had found my mind wandered. Chapter 2 in "Search Inside Yourself" discusses that this is very common and it is healthy to keep trying. </p>

      <p>I also thought that meditation was only to help your mind, but I was amazed to find that it also helps your body in terms of building a stronger immunity system and helping heal things faster.</p>

    <li>New things I learnt about meditation</li>
      
      <p>As above. Also that when you are not thinking about anything and being mindful, your state of mind is happy. Also, there is no one right way to meditate, but there are certain techniques that help you meditate.</p>

    <li>What meditation techniques stood out to me</li>

      <p>Have your eyes shut and then open them slightly when you feel like you are drifting off. I thought it was interesting to focus on bringing back your focus, rather than thinking negatively. Also being conscious of your minds thoughts is important in training it to keep these thoughts out. </p>

    <li>Misc</li>
      
      <p>II thought it was interesting that if you consciously train your mind to think positively, subconsciously your mind starts to become more positive when you aren't thinking about it.</p>
