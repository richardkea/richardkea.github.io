    <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>

<p>I feel as if all the learning is up to you, you have to seek the information rather than be spoonfeed like traditional education. Dev Academy is a community, rather than students trying to be better than other students. I thought the kitchen analogy that Shereef used was effective in explaining the best way to learn. DBC/EDA seem to facilitate a culture where people aren't afraid to ask for help and are keen to help others.</p>

    <li>What are your impressions?</li>

<p>I feel as if it is going to be incredibly fast paced and challenging. It is a slight shock to the system not having as much guidance as I have had at school and university, but feel as if I am achieving more and learning more effectively. Going forward I am excited and curious as to what is to come!</p>

<li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>

<p> I see myself doing well in this culture. This week I have felt like other people have shot ahead in a sense, but I want to be able to help others if I know any skills/info that they don't. I'm definitely a team player. My perception is that Dev supplies a range of resources that are relevant to what you are doing but do not tell you exactly how to do it. This week it made me feel as if I was incapable, but I understand that it is simply done this well because it is the most effective way in helping me learn.</p>

<li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>

<p> Yes they have definitely changed. I knew EDA would be challenging but I didn't realise how challenging. Now I know why "time management" has been brought up so much already. </p>

<li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>

<p>Yes I am excited. I feel like there is a lot of unknown and yes this makes me feel nervouce, but excited, as I have learned so much just in this first week.</p>
