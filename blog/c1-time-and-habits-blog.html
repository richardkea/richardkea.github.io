    <li>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>

<p>After going through these articles, videos, blogs etc. it made me realise that this week I have been ineffective in more ways than I thought. I think I am trying to rush things and do long bursts, but I have found myself becoming distracted and stressed at times, which is not how I want to work. Since going through these resources, I realise that I need to think about what I have done, manage my time better, using techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique and maybe even try meditation.  </p>

<li>what did you find interesting?</li>

<p>My favourite resource was the video with Charles Duhigg and Ramit Sethi about creating good habits and why it is important to. I found their perspectives interesting in terms of attitude causing behaviour and forcing yourself to have an attitude until it becomes second nature, thus leading to natural changes in behaviour.  </p>

<li>what worked for you?</li>

<p>Nothing yet, but next week I will try to take a few of these techniques on board and see what works best</p>

<li>which will you experiment further with?</li>

<p>Meditation. I think the symptoms meditation are found to help alleviate are ones that I have. I think focussing on changing my habits, such as checking emails, Facebook etc will be a priority going forward. Having a time-frame will be key to make sure I use my time wisely within the "timebox". </p>

<li>Extra Comment</li>
<p> After reading the 'Flow' wiki page I discovered that I am easily distracted and because I feel quite overwhelmed I tend to find myself getting anxious. I need to take more structured and useful breaks. </p>
