  <li>
  What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
  </li>

    <p>I learnt that I sometimes read into things with that person, because they don't like to expand on certain things. They don't want to make things seem "over the top". They realised that they sometimes don't communicate effectively, as they aren't aware of what they are saying. I learnt that I am a good communicator when I slow down and think before I speak.</p>

  <li>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</li>
    <p>
    Without a doubt I will use the circuit training technique. I think it was interesting to train your mind using different techniques, as these different techniques help strengthen the overall ability to meditate. What I mean by this is focussing on something neutral for three minutes and thinking about my breathing, then for three minutes, focus on everything but be aware of each thing that crosses my mind.
    </p>

  <li>Misc</li>
    <p>
      I think it was interesting to be fully involved with listening to someone, that you don't even let your emotions come into play and "inner chat".
