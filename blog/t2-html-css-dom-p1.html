  <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? (in words that a non-technical person may understand)</li>

  <p> HTML stands for 'HyperText Markup Language'. It is a tool used to create the basic content on a website. Certain commands are typed that are registered by the computer. "Tags" are assigned to different segments of the content. For example this part that you are looking at right now is assigned a "p" tag which stands for paragraph. Text is entered between the tags. This enables the computer to understand where you are entering text. Tags also make styling possible when another language "css" is used. I will talk about this in a second.
</p>

<p>CSS stands for 'Cascading Style Sheet'. It is a coding language that can be used alongside HTML. Like HTML certain commands are entered that help create changes to different sections of html and this gives enables us to style the html. CSS gives the user power to change HTML font, position of text/images, colours and other basic 'static' content.  </p>

<p>DOM stands for The Document Object Model. DOM's are a bit more difficult to explain. DOM is the way that HTML is formatted to provide a logical structure for the code to run. HTML can be entered in lots of different ways and can provide the same output when looking at the finished product. The DOM is a way of standardising how HTML is typed out, in order for it to be logically understood by other coders. A good analogy for DOM is a tree. There is a trunk which is the body of code, then branches off this and then twigs. This is how HTML should be formatted.  </p>


  <li>What is meant by boxifying design?</li>
  <p>It is where you actively create your code to fit into physical or invisble boxes. This helps divide up your page to be more practical, as well as improving aesthetics.  </p>

  <li>What is the box model?</li>
  <p>It is a box element that contains an image or text. It comes from CSS styling and wraps HTML content.  </p>
