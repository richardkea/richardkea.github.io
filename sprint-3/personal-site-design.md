1) What is my sites primary purpose?

To showcase my new html and css learning to people involved in EDA and to family/friends and to show myself what I can/have achieved.

2) Who is your Target Audience

My target audience is other EDA members and friends and family.

3) How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want people to see that it is my personal website. I want them to be able to easily access my different blog pages and read my blogs. I want them to have a hedonic experience and enjoy having a look on my website.

4) How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I will create a site that focusses on the most important things at the top left of the website. Using an 'f' shape styled website. I will use images to help create a hedonic vibe and label these images tastefully. 

I will create my blog pages so they are easy to use, using the idea of having a 'reactive' website that can be accessed and enjoyed on multiple devices. I will make sure to limit the size of the lines and the amount of content shown at a page at one time.
